# Computer-Systems-Assembly-Labs
Labs which goes over the process and displays the fundamentals of Boolean algebra, implementation of Boolean operators as combinational logic gates in increasing complexity, from simple AND/OR gates to more complicated digital logic designs such as adders, shifters, decoders/encoders and a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit. Also utilizes simple sequential logic gate behavior such as those of latches and synchronous D flip flops. Represents numeric information across various bases, example base 2, 10, octal, hexadecimal, 1s complement, 2s complement representation, IEEE single/double precision representation, ASCII format, etc. Adding on employs basic bitwise operation concepts and shifting/rotating. Throughout the Labs the Von Neuman computer model(heart of all modern processor designs) is made use of and apply the RISC-V assembly language and how it interacts directly with a computer's memory model as opposed to the abstraction presented in a high-level programming language like C, C++ or Python.
